This repository is for the development of a real-time learning assistant used to help beginner guitarists practice. 

The intention with this product is to enable users to effectively learn basic guitar skills with real-time feedback.

The product works by first prompting the user to play a random chord/note/scale etc... (screen)
If the user plays correctly, the screen will show correct (âœ“) and moves on to the next random shape
If the user plays incorrectly, the screen will show wrong (X) and briefly show the correct shape. Then it will prompt the same item again.

The device has to react to the signal received from the guitar, and determine if the sound is correct or not.
